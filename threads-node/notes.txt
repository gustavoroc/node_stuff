- How does the Node.JS works behind the scenes?

1) Stack: 
    - Is the node single-thread from NODE (executes the code);

2) Background Threads (Libuv): 
    - Executes the asynchronous functions of the stack, is 
      C++ based. The Libuv starts another threads to deal with 
      those functions.

- OBS: asynchronous functions like readFile, HTTP Requests don't need worker threads from NODE,
 they already are optimized and uses the OS to make this kind of things, they already multi-thread.
