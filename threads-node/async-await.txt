- The async-await is just a syntax sugar to promises. It calls
the event loop scheduling the code to be executed in the LIBUV.

" Through these APIs jobs are scheduled, buffered in the micro task queue,
 which will be tapped and executed by the event loop when idle.
Thus the asynchronicity is in fact just scheduling."
